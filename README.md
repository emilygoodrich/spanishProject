# spanishProject

This is my React project that I created for school. It was meant to be a presentation, so it doesn't have many words on it. I needed something original to put on my GitHub, so I used this. I'm not much of a designer lol

It has:
- a Spanish/English toggle (the flag)
- React Routing
